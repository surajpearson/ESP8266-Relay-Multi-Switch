# ESP8266-Relay-Multi-Switch

Warning: Be extra careful while dealing with AC power. 

I have used a 2 port replay switch for this experiment. 

Connect the GPIO port 4 and 5 to the relay input lines. VCC to the the 5v line and GND to ground. 

The reply will be controlled with the switches you see in the browser. 

Connect the live wires to the other side of the replay to control 2 different devives ( I control 2 lamps).
